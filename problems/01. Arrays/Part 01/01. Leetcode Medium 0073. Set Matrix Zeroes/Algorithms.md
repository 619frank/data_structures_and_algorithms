### Using Additional Sets
Algorithm: Use two sets to keep track of rows and columns that need to be zeroed. Iterate through the matrix to populate these sets, and then iterate again to set the appropriate rows and columns to 0.

Time Complexity: O(m * n)

Space Complexity: O(m + n)

### Using First Row and Column as Markers (Optimal)
Algorithm: Use the first row and first column to mark the rows and columns that need to be zeroed. Use separate variables to track whether the first row and first column should be zeroed. Iterate through the matrix to set markers, then update the matrix based on these markers.

Time Complexity: O(m * n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
