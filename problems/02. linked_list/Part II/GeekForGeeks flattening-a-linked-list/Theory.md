Flattening a Linked List

Given a Linked List of size n, where every node represents a sub-linked-list and contains two pointers:
(i) a next pointer to the next node,
(ii) a bottom pointer to a linked list where this node is head.
Each of the sub-linked-list is in sorted order.
Flatten the Link List such that all the nodes appear in a single level while maintaining the sorted order. 

Note: The flattened list will be printed using the bottom pointer instead of the next pointer.
For more clarity have a look at the printList() function in the driver code.

 

Examples:

Input:
5 -> 10 -> 19 -> 28
|     |     |     | 
7     20    22   35
|           |     | 
8          50    40
|                 | 
30               45
Output:  5-> 7-> 8- > 10 -> 19-> 20-> 22-> 28-> 30-> 35-> 40-> 45-> 50.
Explanation: The resultant linked lists has every node in a single level.(Note: | represents the bottom pointer.)
Input:

7          22

Output: 5-> 7-> 8-> 10-> 19-> 22-> 28-> 30-> 50
Explanation: The resultant linked lists has every node in a single level.(Note: | represents the bottom pointer.)
